                        Poppy Seed Blueberry<br>
                        Baked Oatmeal</strong>! This gorgeous baked oatmeal
                    quickly became one of the most <br>
                    popular breakfast recipes on AK, and for good reason.
                </p>
                <p> <strong>We have many different ways that you can
                        customize this baked oatmeal to truly <br>
                        make it your own.</strong> Check them out below and,
                    of course, read through the <strong>recipe <br>
                        blog post</strong> itself for all of the tips youll
                    need.

                <ul class="text-72">
                    <li> <strong>Choose your berry.</strong> If youre out of
                        fresh blueberries feel free to use frozen! I <br>
                        think raspberries, blackberries, or chopped cherries
                        would also be delicious in <br>
                        this recipe.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Switch your sweetener.</strong> This baked
                        oatmeal would be delicious with honey <br>
                        instead of maple syrup, too, however I do recommend
                        using a bit less honey <br>
                        (maybe 1/4 cup) if you opt for that option.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swap the seeds.</strong> Out of poppy seeds?
                        Feel free to sub 1 tablespoon of chia seeds, <br>
                        or skip the seeds altogether.</li>
                    <li><strong>To make it dairy free:</strong> use vegan
                        butter or coconut oil within the oatmeal bake. <br>
                        You can then use your favorite dairy free yogurt in
                        the glaze, or skip the glaze — it <br>
                        will still be fabulous.</li>
                    <li><strong>To make it gluten free:</strong> simply use
                        gluten free rolled oats.</li>
                </ul>
